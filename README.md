# Robotics-Competition-China

As Vice-President of the Coding and Robotics Society in Liverpool, UK, I was invited with other committee members to attend a robotics competition in Shanghai, China. Since I was responsible for the coding supervision of the project, I also implemented C based Arduino programming to create a hand gesture controller to wireless drive a smart car we built from scratch.

In the two files shared on this repository there is the code we used to program the smart car and the code I personally implemented for the hand gesture controller.
